<p>This initiatve came about after an extended period of no
maintenance being performed to the Alfabet system for any of the
regional application entries by my predesessors. As soon as I assumed
the role of Data Steward for the region, I realised that there was
some structure and discipline required towards updating and
maintaining the Alfabet system. This led to my complete review and
rework of the data within my sphere of responsibility.</p>
<p>1. Current state review</p>
<p>- Review the current entries contained within the Alfabet system.</p>
<p>- Check validatity of existing information in Alfabet with the
relevant system owners</p>
<p>2. System cleanup</p>
<p>- Remove stale records from Alfabet</p>
<p>- Identify and remove duplicate entries in association with Group
Architecture team 
</p>
<p>3. Engage business stakeholders</p>
<p>- Engage business stakeholders across the region regarding the use
of Alfabet system</p>
<p>- Share a summary report of existing info per business are with
relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>4. Gather application information</p>
<p>- Request a review from business stakeholders of shared report as
well as any additional info available regarding applications in use
within their business area</p>
<p>- Consolidate the collected information and compare to existing
entries in Alfabet</p>
<p>5. Capture new information</p>
<p>- Capture new entries according to company naming standard</p>
<p>- Extract a new detailed report per business are and provide to
relevant stakeholders</p>
<p>- Update Financial info for Systems/Applications</p>
<p>6. Implement system integration &amp; automation</p>
<p>- Review the existing network and application management tool sets
available across the organisation</p>
<p>- Implement any extensions required to these discovery tools to
facilitate the automation of new software system discovery, including
a notification to myself to engage with system owners for additional
upon discovery</p>
<p>- Add an additional task to the Change Management template for
System Commissioning anddecommissioning to update/notify the Data
Steward for the System/Application being commissioned or
decommissioned.</p>
<p>7. Maintain Software Catalog info (New system commissioning, old
system retirement)</p>
<p>- Review validity of current Alfabet entries</p>
<p>- Check with App Onwrs/Business owners for any lifecycle
changes/updates</p>
<p>- Review any Software maintenance agreements up for renewals</p>
<p>8. Management Reporting</p>
<p>- perform quarterly managemernt reports for Lifecycle of
applcations</p>
<p>- Compare budget numbers to any applications due for
retirement/decommissioning</p>
<p>- Review and report on any savings opportunities w.r.t early
retirement of any applications/ systems being used on consumptive
basis.</p>
